# bostonhacks2018-react-workshop

Here's the code for the React workshop @ BostonHacks 2018!

## Notes

I've uploaded the code for `src/App.js` and `src/App.css` -- just remember that you can find these files yourself in the `/src` folder when you create a new React app!

Good luck everyone this weekend! Thanks again for coming!
